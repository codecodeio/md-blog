# Markdown Blog
A blog that displays articles written in markdown. Built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). Deploy SvelteKit on Vercel in minutes. 

Even if your content is accessible it is likely in a proprietary format that is not easily transferrable. Write your content once in markdown and deploy anywhere.

# Built with create-svelte


```bash
# create a new project in folder md-blog
npm create svelte@latest md-blog
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
